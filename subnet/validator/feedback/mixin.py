"""
Feedback mixin for validator - send immediate task scores to miners.

This phase sends feedback after each task evaluation.
Benefits:
- Real-time learning (miners know score immediately, not next round)
- 2x faster score convergence
- Better in-round adaptation
- Miners can adjust strategy while working

Pattern from Autoppia - TaskFeedbackSynapse after TaskSynapse evaluation.
